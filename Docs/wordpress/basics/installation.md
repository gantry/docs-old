Installation
============
The Gantry framework itself is independent of any template. Each Gantry-enabled template relies on the Gantry framework to provide the underlying base and extensive functionality that enables the creation of such powerful sites.

Downloading Gantry
------------------
Gantry has three available download types:

* __Framework__: This contains only the Framework plugin.
* __Template__: This contains just the Gantry template.
* __RocketLauncher__: This includes the full WordPress installation, Framework (plugin) and the pre-configured Gantry template (only for NEW installations).

Depending on choosed package you should install the Gantry Framework like a standard WordPress plugin and Gantry Default Template like any other template. If you don't have WordPress installed you can use RocketLauncher package as it contains full pre-configured Gantry environment and is installed exactly the same like a regular WordPress installation. Select whichever download option is best for you, we recommend the RocketLauncher for first time installs.
