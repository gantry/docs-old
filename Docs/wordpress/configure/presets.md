> Creating a custom preset is a very simple task with Gantry. Check out this short video on how to customize your layout then create a custom preset based on your configuration options.

Gantry Presets are a combination of Gantry features and configuration settings which allow you to create predefined groupings for the entire template as well as on a per-override basis. Presets can consist of any Gantry configuration option such css style, link color, background and body graphic levels, font settings, and much more.


Creating a new Preset
---------------------
To configure a new preset, go to **Admin Dashboard → Gantry Theme → Style**. Configure any style settings for the template such as Link Color.

Select your new Preset
----------------------
Click on the **Presets** button to display all available presets. Your new preset will display in the preset slider. Click on the preset to load your custom style settings. Select **Save** to load the preset.

After a preset is created, you can create a thumbnail image in the `admin/presets/` folder with the filename structure **keyname.png** where keyname is the Keyname from the modal dialog box.
