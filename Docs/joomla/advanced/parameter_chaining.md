Parameter Chaining
==================
During the development of the Gantry Framework, we found that we needed to organize sets of parameters into custom groups of related settings. You can create your own elements in *templateDetails.xml* to allow the setting of specific parameters which you can use later in your own features, layouts, etc. A good example of this is the **inactive** chain that controls what menu item should be displayed when the menu is inactive. The XML in question looks like this:

~~~ .xml
<param name="inactive" type="chain" label="INACTIVE"  description="INACTIVE_DESC">
    <param name="enabled" type="toggle" default="1" label="ENABLED"  setinmenuitem="false" />
    <param name="menuitem" type="menuitem" label="SELECT_MENU_ITEM" setinmenuitem="false" />
</param>
~~~

This parameter block consists of a parent **chain** element. This element has a name called **inactive**. Within the chain, are two elements. One is a toggle called **enabled**, and the other is a menuitem element named **menuitem**.

Now, you could get the values of these parameters just by using the call:

~~~ .php
global $gantry;
echo $gantry->get('inactive-enabled');
echo $gantry->get('inactive-menuitem');
~~~

However, within Gantry we have a feature to handle the 'inactive' state, and therefore we have a core feature called **GantryFeatureInactive** that looks like this:

~~~ .php
class GantryFeatureInactive extends GantryFeature {
    var $_feature_name = 'inactive';

    function init() {
        global $gantry, $Itemid;

        $enabled = $this->get('enabled');
        if($enabled) {
            $menus = &JSite::getMenu();
            $menu  = $menus->getActive();
            if (null == $menu){
                $menuitem = $this->get('menuitem');
                $menus->setActive($menuitem);
                $Itemid = $menuitem;
            }
        }
    }
}
~~~

Features, by default, are looking for a chained set of parameters. So, by setting the `$_feature_name` to **inactive**, and using the feature's own built in `get()` method, we don't need to use the full **inactive-menuitem** chained name. The feature's method automatically prefixes the feature name to obtain the correct parameter.
