Advanced
========
The **Advanced** panel in the Gantry-based template administration interface provides several settings for configuring the menu options for the template. The following configuration options are available:


Display Component
-----------------
The **Display Component** option allows you to enable/disable the output of the Joomla component on the front page. This is useful for sites and templates that want to make use of a front page that consists entirely of modules, with only subpages showing the Joomla component output.

Mainbody Enabled
----------------
The **Mainbody Enabled** option allows you to enable/disable the entire mainbody section. This is useful for sites and templates that want to make use of a front page that consists entirely of modules with only subpages showing the Joomla component output.

RTL Support
-----------
RTL means “right-to-left” and is a key component when trying to deliver a website in an RTL language such as Hebrew, Arabic, Urdu, etc. Gantry has built in RTL support which will automatically “flip” the content layouts and ordering to support RTL. This option allows you to enable/disable the built-in RTL support which is automatically detected and displayed based on the language file setting.

Page Suffix
-----------
The Page Suffix option allows you to enable/disable page suffix classes being appended to the body tag. With this option enabled, any page suffix classes used for particular pages in joomla will have that suffix added to the body tag to allow for styling and customization on a page by page basis.

Less Compiler
-------------
Less is used for all the CSS, which is a server side compiler. These options allow you to determine the delay on that compiling process, whether CSS compression is also infused within it, or if you wish to debug the header. There is also a button to clear the LESS cache.
