Style
=====
The **Style** panel in the Gantry based template administration interface provides several options for configuring the main stylistic aspects of the template. While the default Gantry template includes several options, you can easily add and configure many more, based on your template's needs. The following configuration options are available by default:


Logo
----
The Logo setting provides the ability to show/hide the logo, select its position, or changes its type. By default, this is **Gantry Template** which allows you to load three different style options for **Logo Style**.

The second logo type option is **Custom**. This will load the **Custom Logo** field, where you can **Select** an image through the Media Manager.

The Link Color setting provides the ability to easily change the main color for template links. Colors can be inputted via the color chooser popup selector, or manually using a hex code in the input field.
